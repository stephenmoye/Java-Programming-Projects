// 11. Circuit Board Profit
// An electronics company sells circuit boards at a 40 percent profit. If you know the retail
// price of a circuit board, you can calculate its profit with the following formula:
// Profit = Retail price Ã— 0.4
// Write a program that asks the user for the retail price of a circuit board, calculates the
// amount of profit earned for that product, and displays the results on the screen.
