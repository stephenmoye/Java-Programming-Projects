// Distance Traveled
// The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
// Distance 5 Speed * Time
// For example, if a train travels 40 miles-per-hour for three hours, the distance traveled is
// 120 miles. Write a program that asks for the speed of a vehicle (in miles-per-hour) and the
// number of hours it has traveled. It should use a loop to display the distance a vehicle has
// traveled for each hour of a time period specified by the user. For example, if a vehicle is
// traveling at 40 mph for a three-hour time period, it should display a report similar to the
// one that follows:
// Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any value
// less than 1 for time traveled.
