// An Internet service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:
// Package A: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided. Additional hours

// Package B: For $13.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided. Additional hours
// are $1.00 per hour.
// Package C: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.
// Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask the user to enter
// the letter of the package the customer has purchased (A, B, or C) and the number of hours
// that were used. It should then display the total charges.
